proxmox-datacenter-manager (0.2.2) trixie; urgency=medium

  * api server: make incoming connection handling more robust for some error
    cases.

  * qemu: enable connection tracking state transfer on VM remote live
    migration. Note that this is best effort as the network equipment and
    especially third party firewall in the target environment can still cause
    resets for open connections.

  * remote tasks: implement improved cache for remote tasks to split the
    single file cache into an 'active' and multiple 'archive' files. This
    improves lookup performance by around three orders of magnitude (from
    seconds to milliseconds) on benchmarks with 1.5 million tasks in the
    cache. Further the data structure was optimized for space, avoiding
    redundant information and older archived tasks will get compressed using
    zstd, which results in some significant reduction of storage space usage.
    This helps especially when there are many tasks, like when using many
    remotes with a big amount of guests.

  * remote tasks: add background task for polling task from all configured
    remotes every 10 minutes, use new task cache. Active tasks are tracked
    separately and their status is re-queried every 10 seconds.

  * api: add probe-tls endpoint to allow trust on first use (TOFU) prompts for
    when adding remotes.

  * api: acme cert order: fix constructing config with "default" account.

proxmox-datacenter-manager (0.1.10) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * privileged api: do not clean-up socket unconditionally on start-up but
    only before freshly creating it. This should fix an issue where the
    unprivileged, main API dameon could not proxy to the privileged API
    daemon anymore after the latter was reloaded. Which, for example, can
    happen when installing package updates.

  * privileged api: output log message before signaling readiness to systemd.
